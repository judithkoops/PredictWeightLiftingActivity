# PredictWeightLiftingActivity

The goal of the project is to predict the manner in which people performed a weight-lifting exercise. Three different manners are identified under variable "classe":

* Class A -- exactly according to the specification
* Class B -- throwing the elbows to the front
* Class C -- lifting the dumbbell only halfway
* Class D -- lowering the dumbbell only halfway
* Class E -- throwing the hips to the front

Random forest is used to establish which predictors best predict which weight lifting activity. Cross-validation was examined using a testing dataset.
